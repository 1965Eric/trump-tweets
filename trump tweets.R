# During the 2016 US presidential election, then-candidate Donald J. Trump used his Twitter account as a way to communicate with potential voters. 
# On August 6, 2016 Todd Vaziri tweeted (https://twitter.com/tvaziri/status/762005541388378112) about Trump that "Every non-hyperbolic tweet is from iPhone (his staff). Every hyperbolic tweet is from Android (from him)."
# Data scientist David Robinson conducted an analysis (http://varianceexplained.org/r/trump-tweets/) to determine if data supported this assertion. Here we go through David's analysis to learn some of the basics of text mining.
# To learn more about text mining in R we recommend https://www.tidytextmining.com.

# We will use the following libraries:

library(tidyverse)
library(ggplot2)
library(lubridate)
library(tidyr)
library(scales)
set.seed(1)

# In general, we can extract data directly from Twitter using the rtweet package. 
# However, in this case, a group has already compiled data for us and made it available at http://www.trumptwitterarchive.com.

url <- 'http://www.trumptwitterarchive.com/data/realdonaldtrump/%s.json'
trump_tweets <- map(2009:2017, ~sprintf(url, .x)) %>%
  map_df(jsonlite::fromJSON, simplifyDataFrame = TRUE) %>%
  filter(!is_retweet & !str_detect(text, '^"')) %>%
  mutate(created_at = parse_date_time(created_at, orders = "a b! d! H!:M!:S! z!* Y!", tz="EST")) 

# For convenience we include the result of the code above in the dslabs package.

library(dslabs)
data("trump_tweets")

# This is the data frame with information about the tweet.

head(trump_tweets)

# The variables that are included are.

names(trump_tweets)

# The tweets are represented by the text variable.

trump_tweets %>% select(text) %>% head

# And the source variable tells us the device that was used to compose and upload each tweet.

trump_tweets %>% count(source) %>% arrange(desc(n))

# We can use extract to remove the Twitter for part of the source and filter out retweets.

trump_tweets %>% 
  extract(source, "source", "Twitter for (.*)") %>%
  count(source) 

# We are interested in what happened during the campaign, so for the analysis here we will focus on what was tweeted between the day Trump announced his campaign and election day. 
# So we define the following table.

campaign_tweets <- trump_tweets %>% 
  extract(source, "source", "Twitter for (.*)") %>%
  filter(source %in% c("Android", "iPhone") &
           created_at >= ymd("2015-06-17") & 
           created_at < ymd("2016-11-08")) %>%
  filter(!is_retweet) %>%
  arrange(created_at)

# We can now use data visualization to explore the possibility that two different groups were tweeting from these devices. 
# For each tweet, we will extract the hour, in the east coast (EST), it was tweeted then compute the proportion of tweets tweeted at each hour for each device.

ds_theme_set()
campaign_tweets %>%
  mutate(hour = hour(with_tz(created_at, "EST"))) %>%
  count(source, hour) %>%
  group_by(source) %>%
  mutate(percent = n / sum(n)) %>%
  ungroup %>%
  ggplot(aes(hour, percent, color = source)) +
  geom_line() +
  geom_point() +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = percent_format()) +
  labs(x = "Hour of day (EST)",
       y = "% of tweets",
       color = "")

# We notice a big peak for the Android in early hours of the morning, between 6 and 8 AM. There seems to be a clear different in these patterns. 
# We will therefore assume that two different entities are using these two devices. Now we will study how their tweets differ. To do this we introduce the tidytext package.

# The tidytext package helps us convert free from text into a tidy table. Having the data in this format greatly facilitates data visualization and applying statistical techniques.
